# ktane_defuser
I'm trying out python and as a learning project I'm making this defusal tool for the game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"

The program first asks what module you wish to defuse, then it asks you a series of questions which should give you the correct answers to defuse the modules and eventually the entire bomb

Currently functioning: Buttons and Simple wires
In progress: Keypads (symbols) and Simon says
To come: Who's on first, Memory, Morse code, Complicated wires, Wire sequences, Mazes, Passwords, and Gas Knob
